# Welcome to MULTIBINIT

**NOTE: This website is under construction. Please check back later for more information.**


MULTIBINIT is a platform for automatic construction of second-principle models and large-scale simulations of materials. It make use of results of first-principles calculations, and build effective models which demands much less computational resources while preserving the accuracy of it.

This website provides resources for users to learn how to use MULTIBINIT, and examples of applications.
